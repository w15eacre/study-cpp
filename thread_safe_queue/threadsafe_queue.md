## üì¶ ThreadSafeQueue

üîí A thread-safe queue implementation built with `std::mutex`.

* Written as a **C++20 module**;
* Provides `push`, `try_pop`, `wait_and_pop` interfaces;
* Fully tested using **GoogleTest**.

> üìñ Inspired by "C++ Concurrency in Action" by Anthony Williams.

### Example

```cpp
ThreadSafeQueue<int> queue;

queue.Push(42);
int value{};
if (queue.TryPop(value)) {
    std::cout << "Got: " << value << std::endl;
}
```

## üöÄ Queue Performance Comparison: ThreadSafeQueue vs ThreadSafeQueueMutex vs ThreadSafeStdQueue

Benchmarks comparing three thread-safe queue implementations under various producer/consumer loads.

### üñ•Ô∏è System Specs

* **Architecture:** x86\_64
* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800X (8 cores, 16 threads)
* **RAM:** 32 GB DDR4
* **OS:** Debian 12

### üß© Implementations

1. **ThreadSafeQueue**

   * Custom singly-linked queue;
   * Two mutexes: separate locks for front and back;
   * Reduces producer/consumer contention.

2. **ThreadSafeQueueMutex**

   * Same structure as above, but with a single shared mutex;
   * Simpler design, but more contention.

3. **ThreadSafeStdQueue**

   * Wraps `std::queue<T>`;
   * Uses one mutex;
   * Easy to implement, good performance in light-to-moderate concurrency.

### üìä Performance Table (ms)

> * `p` ‚Äî number of **producers**
> * `c` ‚Äî number of **consumers**

> For example, `5p_10c` means 5 producer threads and 10 consumer threads.

### üîé Observations

* ‚úÖ `ThreadSafeStdQueue` is the fastest across most scenarios, especially low-concurrency.
* ‚úÖ `ThreadSafeQueue` provides balanced performance with less contention.
* üö´ `ThreadSafeQueueMutex` consistently performs worst under high load.

### üîÅ Validation Note

All tests were repeated, and results were consistent. The original conclusions are confirmed.
